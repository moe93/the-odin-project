        <!-- ChatGPT prompt: Tell me a story about an anthropomorphic cat saying goodbye to his children as he goes to buy milk and then abandoning them for his secret family -->
        <p>Once upon a time, there was a cat named Felix who lived with his family in a cozy little house by the sea. Felix was a highly skilled engineer, and he spent his days working on complex projects at a nearby laboratory.</p>
        <p>Every morning, Felix would say goodbye to his three young children and head off to work. His children, two boys and a girl, loved their father very much and were always sad to see him go.</p>
        <p>But what Felix's children didn't know was that their father had a secret life. Felix was actually a mer-cat, part of a secret society of cats who lived beneath the waves.</p>
        <p>For years, Felix had managed to keep his two lives separate, but now he could no longer bear the burden of his secret. He knew he had to choose between his two families.</p>
        <p>As he walked out the door on that fateful morning, Felix made up his mind. He knew he couldn't continue to live a double life any longer. He turned around and said goodbye to his children, knowing it would be the last time he saw them.</p>
        <p>Felix's heart was heavy as he made his way to the ocean, but he knew it was the right thing to do. He hoped that one day his children would understand his decision and forgive him.</p>
        <p>As he swam away, Felix knew that he had made the right choice. He was finally free to live the life he had always dreamed of, even if it meant leaving behind the ones he loved.</p>
