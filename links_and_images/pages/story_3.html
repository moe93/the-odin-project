            <!-- ChatGPT prompt: Tell me a story about an anthropomorphic cat saying goodbye to his children as he goes to buy milk and then abandoning them for his secret family -->
            <p>
                Once upon a time, there was an anthropomorphic cat named Tom who lived
                with his family in a cozy little house in the countryside. Tom had
                three young children, two boys and a girl, whom he loved more than
                anything in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day, Tom decided to go to the store to buy some milk for his
                family's breakfast. He kissed his children goodbye and told them he
                would be back soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                As he walked down the road, Tom couldn't help but think about all the
                secrets he had been keeping from his family. He had a secret life, one
                that he had kept hidden from his children and even from his wife.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tom had always been a bit of a wanderer at heart, and he had always
                longed for adventure. He had met a group of cats who shared his love
                of exploration, and together they had formed a secret society of
                adventurers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tom had kept his secret life a secret for so long, but now he couldn't
                take it anymore. He knew he had to choose between his two families.
            </p>
            <p>
                As he walked into the store, Tom made up his mind. He knew he couldn't
                continue to live a double life any longer. He turned around and walked
                out of the store, leaving his family and his old life behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tom knew it would be hard to say goodbye to his children, but he also
                knew that it was the right thing to do. He hoped that one day they
                would understand his decision and forgive him.
            </p>
            <p>
                As he walked away, Tom knew that he had made the right choice. He was
                finally free to live the life he had always dreamed of, even if it
                meant leaving behind the ones he loved.
